# Telling-Stories-with-Data

## About me
Hi all! My name is Evan (he/him). This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at Heinz College. I'm a second-year Master of Arts Management student. I'm interested in the financial operations of arts organizations. Outside of school, I'm a Bookkeeper for a consulting firm that outsources financial management for NYC-based arts & cultural institutions. I've worked at organizations including Interlochen Center for the Arts, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MASS MoCA), and Pittsburgh Opera. 

Outside of work and school, I enjoy trying out new restaurants in Pittsburgh, CrossFit, seeing regional theatre productions, and taking my dog Beau for walks in Shadyside.

## What I hope to learn
My experience with data viz in the arts management world is minimal, either because there wasn't data in the first place or that we didn't know what story to tell. I'm excited to experiment with data viz and make new discoveries with data sets. I'm definitely curious to see how I can apply course concepts to financial data. Does data viz apply to spreadsheets? How can I use data viz when communicating financial and programmatic activity with my nonprofit's Board of Directors?

After the program, I'm flexible with where I would like to be. My goal is to work in a general management capacity in a nonprofit theatre.
