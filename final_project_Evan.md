### Final Project Part I

### High Level Summary
I'm interested in analyzing the trends of the operating cash reserves of NYC-based arts and cultural organizations over time. I'm curious to see if and how arts and cultural nonprofits are using annual surpluses to fund these unrestricted cash reserves, and how they are affecting their bottom line. 
### Project Structure
- Display the chart of a general trend in cash reserves of NYC-based arts organizations.
- Give audience 5-seconds to digest information and comprehend the visualization.
- Describe the function of the visualization. Explain the general trend of nonprofit operating cash reserves "rainy day funds" grouped by organizational budget size (below $5 million, $5 million to $10 million, above $10 million). Once I discover the trend and the "story" to tell, this is where I will explain my main point.
- Display a conceptual visualization (exploratory, ideas-based) that conveys the role of net assets in a nonprofit organization. 
- Explain the concept of cash reserves in financial management - keeping money away (generated from a surplus) to save for future years. Cash reserves can signal fiscal responsibility and proactiveness for nonprofit organizations that may face future hardship. The most common trigger for use of operating reserves is on the income side, such as when a previously reliable source is reduced or withdrawn.
- Explain any significant shifts in unrestricted cash reserves over the past few years, and why those shifts may have occurred (COVID, Government relief funding, etc.)
- Show where on the organization's audited financial statements that this information is accessible.

### Data
I will be collecting data from the New York State Charities Bureau website, on their Charities Search Tool. The website contains the audited financial statements, Form 990, and other tax filings (current and historical) for any charity registered in New York State. 

I will be accessing each organization's self-reported audited financial statements from the website to find if they have any operating cash reserve. On an audited financials, the organization will report any cash reserves under Net Assets in the Statement of Financial Position, otherwise known as a Balance Sheet. I will compile a list of NYC nonprofit performing arts organizations that I want to research, and categorize them into three categories: operating budget below $5 million, $5 million to $10 million, and above $10 million. For each organization, I will compile a spreadsheet listing each organization's historical unrestricted operating net assets/cash reserve, categorized by each year.

### Method and Medium
I'll be using Shorthand to walk my audience through the concept of cash reserves in nonprofit arts organizations. 
My first step in the final project will be collecting audited financial statements, entering cash reserves data into the spreadsheet, and analyzing any trends (increases, decreases, differences, similarities) between different organizations. For years where a significant change has occurred, I will also analyze the Notes to the Financial Statements, where additional context is often given. 
My next step will be forming a persuasive argument based on the data I have reviewed. I can predict that my argument will argue for the usefulness of a cash reserve for nonprofits, and that my call-to-action will encourage future nonprofit executives to designate a portion of any surplus towards this kind of reserve. To make this argument, I will have to compare the size of an organization's cash reserve to its likelihood of having a surplus using an operating reserve ratio (operating reserves/annual operating expenses).
