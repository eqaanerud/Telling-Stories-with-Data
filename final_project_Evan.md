### Final Project Part I

### High Level Summary
My project will analyze trends in the **operating cash (cash-on-hand)** of NYC-based nonprofit theaters over the past five years. I'm curious to see trends in which theaters are doing cash-wise, and if their revenue model or reserve strategy has a positive impact on their cash levels. 

### Project Structure
##### INTRODUCTION:
- (TEXT ON SCREEN): Did you know that most NYC nonprofit theaters typically have less than one month of cash-on-hand? (Gilman Foundation)
- (VISUAL): Display chart of 12 calendars, with only one chart filled in green. 
- Nonprofit organizations should have about 3-6 months of Operating Cash to cushion against unforseen expenses and uneven cash flow.
- Why are theaters so strapped for cash? And what has the pandemic done to their cash levels? 

##### MAIN POINT 1: Cash-on-hand differs between theaters of different budget sizes
- (VISUAL): Display chart of a general trend in cash-on-hand over the past five years with three categories of theaters: budgets under $3 million, budgets between $3 million and $10 million, and budgets over $10 million.
- Explain any similarties or differences between cash-on-hand with theaters in the three budget categories.

##### MAIN POINT 2: Cash levels changed dramatically during the pandemic
- (VISUAL): Focus on the same graph but through only 2019 to 2021, or whatever data is most recent. 
- Explain these significant shifts, and why they may have occurred (COVID spending, limited income, Government relief funding, etc.)

##### MAIN POINT 3: What are the healthy theaters doing well?
- (VISUAL): Graphs of organizations that use cash reserves to aid any deficits. 

##### CALL TO ACTION: Unrestricted Cash Reserves
- Cash reserves can signal fiscal responsibility and proactiveness for nonprofit organizations that may face future hardship. The most common trigger for use of operating reserves is on the income side, such as when a previously reliable source is reduced or withdrawn.

### Data
I will be collecting data from the New York State Charities Bureau website, on their Charities Search Tool. The website contains the audited financial statements, Form 990, and other tax filings (current and historical) for any charity registered in New York State. 

I will be accessing each organization's self-reported audited financial statements from the website to find if they have any operating cash reserve. On an audited financials, the organization will report any cash reserves under Net Assets in the Statement of Financial Position, otherwise known as a Balance Sheet. I will compile a list of NYC nonprofit performing arts organizations that I want to research, and categorize them into three categories: operating budget below $5 million, $5 million to $10 million, and above $10 million. For each organization, I will compile a spreadsheet listing each organization's historical unrestricted operating net assets/cash reserve, categorized by each year.

### Method and Medium
I'll be using Shorthand to walk my audience through the concept of cash reserves in nonprofit arts organizations. 
My first step in the final project will be collecting audited financial statements, entering cash reserves data into the spreadsheet, and analyzing any trends (increases, decreases, differences, similarities) between different organizations. For years where a significant change has occurred, I will also analyze the Notes to the Financial Statements, where additional context is often given. 
My next step will be forming a persuasive argument based on the data I have reviewed. I can predict that my argument will argue for the usefulness of a cash reserve for nonprofits, and that my call-to-action will encourage future nonprofit executives to designate a portion of any surplus towards this kind of reserve. To make this argument, I will have to compare the size of an organization's cash reserve to its likelihood of having a surplus using an operating reserve ratio (operating reserves/annual operating expenses).
