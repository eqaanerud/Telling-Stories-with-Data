##### Methodology 
The first visualization's design intention is to compare the debt-to-GDP ratios of various countries. It is static - meaning it is not comparable year-by-year. We can see the Japan, Greece, and Italy lead worldwide with the highest government debts. However, the colors contrast and do not add anything to the visual. 

The second visualization is a bit more focused with its intention. 
With the number of countries represented, I wanted to minimize the clutter that the first grid line of chart brought when designing my second visualization. I experimented with different data visualizations that demonstrate changes over time: heatmaps, area charts, and bubble plots (although bubble plots are more to demonstrate magnitude). I could differentiate between different
