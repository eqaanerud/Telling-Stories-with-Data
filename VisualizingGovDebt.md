# Visualizing Government Debt

### Data Visualization #1
This is my first data visualization.
<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6Ogs" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6Ogs" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2019</a></iframe>

### Data Visualization #2
This is my second data visualization made with Flourish. It illustrates the rising general government debt to GDP ratio across the world.

### Data Visualization #3
This is my third data visualization made with Flourish.

##### Methodology 
The first visualization's design intention is to compare the debt-to-GDP ratios of various countries. It is static - meaning it is not comparable year-by-year. We can see the Japan, Greece, and Italy lead worldwide with the highest government debts. However, the colors contrast and do not add anything informative to the visual. 

The second visualization is more intentional to show the changes over time. However, the grid of charts still feels very cluttered and challenging to make comparisons between countries. There is no focus on significant debt changes in select countries. With the number of countries represented, I wanted to minimize the clutter on my third visualization and highlight key changes. 

First, I experimented with different designs that demonstrate changes over time: heatmaps, area charts, and bubble plots (although bubble plots are more to demonstrate magnitude). I also experimented with color and initially made Japan, USA, and Greece's bars a gradient of green, but then I changed those because you shouldn't use a gradient color palette for categories (Datawrapper). My second visualization was lacking **hierarchy** in how the data was sorted, so the new visualization is ranked top-to-bottom, highest to lowest ratio. Hierarchy is also important in the typography of the chart through variations in size, weight, and emphasis (Coale). I made the title larger and put the sentence of context below it a lighter sans font. 

I also manipulated the design with **animation** so that the viewer could watch the debt-to-GDP ratio change over time. The specific title and differentiated colors signal to the viewer to watch the three countries as their government debts climb over the years.
