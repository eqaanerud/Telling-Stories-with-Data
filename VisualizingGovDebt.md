# Visualizing Government Debt

### Data Visualization #1

### Data Visualization #2
This is my first data visualization made with Flourish. It illustrates the rising general government debt to GDP ratio across the world.

### Data Visualization #3
This is my second data visualization made with Flourish.

##### Methodology 
The first visualization's design intention is to compare the debt-to-GDP ratios of various countries. It is static - meaning it is not comparable year-by-year. We can see the Japan, Greece, and Italy lead worldwide with the highest government debts. However, the colors contrast and do not add anything informative to the visual. 

The second visualization is a bit more intentional to show the changes over time. However, the grid of charts still feels very cluttered and challenging to make comparisons between countries. There is no focus on a few countries, and no specific story being told. With the number of countries represented, I wanted to minimize the clutter on my third visualization and highlight key changes. I experimented with different designs that demonstrate changes over time: heatmaps, area charts, and bubble plots (although bubble plots are more to demonstrate magnitude). I also experimented with color and initially made Japan, USA, and Greece's bars a gradient of green, but then I changed those because you shouldn't use a gradient color palette for categories. I also changed the design so that the viewer could watch the debt-to-GDP ratio change over time. The title and differentiated colors signal to the viewer to watch the three countries as their government debts climb over the years. Because of the variations in the number of reported ratios by each country, the chart gets larger and smaller between the years.
